This is a program that detects if someone is looking at their right, left, or straight. It then sends these results to a raspberry pi which controls an arduino to move a robotic 
car to move in the corresponding directions. I hope to build a wheel chair in the near future that will be controlled by this program. 

Here is a youtube video explaining in more detail:
